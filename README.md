# AuqaWM:
This is a project with the goal of developing our own custom WM compatible Xorg and programs for it developed in GTK.
# About WM:
WM is written entirely in C using only the X11 and Xlibr libraries. All window frame graphics are built using the X11 library, this gives a strong advantage to WM performance. At the time of development of Alpha and Pre-Alpha, errors related to memory leaks may occur in WM. WM has its own config, six desktops, hotkeys for quickly using WM and a bunch of different themes that completely or completely change the AquaWM frame. WM also has partial support for the EWMH (Extended Window Manager Hints) standard.
# About other programs:
A bunch of programs are planned for AquaWM, making AquaWM a full-fledged desktop environment. You can see the name of the programs and their functionality in [`Programs`](programs.txt)
# To install AquaWM, check:
